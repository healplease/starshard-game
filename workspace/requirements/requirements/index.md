# Requirements — index / navigation

> The requirement set + acceptance criteria for "Starshard" (owner: **business-analyst**). Split by
> increment; requirement IDs (R#) and acceptance criteria (AC#) are **append-only and never renumbered**.
> **All files are live, code-matching contract.** Cross-increment *why* → `../history.md`.

## Files (in build order)

## Where is …? (topic → file)
- **R1–R22 / AC1–AC13 (base game)** → `v1-base.md`
- **C3 (~500-line cap) — RETIRED** → noted in `v2.md` (was `v1-base.md`)
- **Bonuses / power-ups (R23–R35)** → `v2.md`
- **Enemy types (R36–R44)** → `v5.md`
- **Bombs + control remap (R45–R55)** → `v6.md`
- **Bosses / Mothership boss fights (R56–R68)** → `v7.md`
- **Pause / Q-hold to quit (R69–R75)** → `v8.md`
- **Q-hold-to-quit on START + GAME_OVER (R76–R82)** → `v10.md`
- **Hold-R-to-restart on PAUSE + GAME_OVER (R83–R91)** → `v12.md`
- **Save system + lifetime-stats counts/screen (R92–R98)** → `v14.md`
- Quick rule: **R1–22→v1 · R23–35→v2 · R36–44→v5 · R45–55→v6 · R56–68→v7 · R69–75→v8 · R76–82→v10 · R83–91→v12 · R92–98→v14**; **AC1–13→v1 · 14–21→v2 · 22–29→v5 · 30–38→v6 · 39–52→v7 · 53–60→v8 · 61–68→v10 · 69–77→v12 · 78–85→v14**.

## Updating this spec
- **New increment:** add `vN.md` (`# vN increment — …`) with the next R#/AC# block (continue the
  numbering — never reuse IDs) + a row + topic-map entry. One-line the why in `../history.md`.
- **Change a shipped requirement:** edit that version's file **in place**; if it changes behavior, the
  downstream specs + `workspace/game/` must follow. Record the why in `../history.md`.
